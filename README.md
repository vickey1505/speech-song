#Emotion Recognition from Audio using CNN-LSTM
This repository contains Google Colab code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to recognize emotions from audio data. The project focuses on leveraging advanced feature extraction, data balancing, and robust regularization techniques to achieve high accuracy and prevent overfitting.
